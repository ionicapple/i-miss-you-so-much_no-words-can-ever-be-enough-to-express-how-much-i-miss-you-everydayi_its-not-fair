# DoNOTInteractWithMyGithubOrElseIWillGet-M-S-K-C-C-Involved-ImVerySerious

im trying to help you out but please do not interact with my github

that really could have been me that you would have cheated on for 8+ yrs (i dunno when your relationship started but im assuming that when i called you in 2018, you guys were together, so thats why there was attitude on the phone)

you are the cruelest person ive ever known/met whatever, and i dont want that for myself

just a complete waste of time

i will take screenshots and escalate things to my manager/PI/group leader at m s k c c if i see activity on github from you or if you call/email me -- i am very very serious

leave me alone

**let this go**

stop wasting my time

nobody helped me with anything, i did it all by myself: i got to rutgers by myself, i got to penn by myself, i got to bethesda by myself, i got to sampled by myself and im now at m s k c c and i made it here by myself

i could spend another 8 yrs by giving you the benefit of the doubt but its exhausting at this point and i just dont want to


im going to reiterate this again, please do NOT contact me in anyway, my SIL is an attorney in nyc we are not weak people, you do not want to do this

you're just messing around with as many women as you can.

you're just not a serious person and i cannot stand that and i will never put up with that.

i realized this as i was recording the voicenote over the weekend, i thought, i dont really want to talk to you, you're such a mean person ... so i finally understood why it never worked out.

im not for putting other women down but ill make a small exception to make a quick point. go to your fking wife if you want someone to make you laugh, dont come to me, you chose her so proudly right over me? so go to her, fk off. is she just not funny, and thats why you're always here? hmmm ... theres nothing you can do for me at this point (or ever actually) but waste my time even more.

my intuition says that you most likely met her on the internet and me, the person who fking drove from philly the night before, you wanted to fk around with, you could just never accept or believe that something good could happen to you with me -- so not only are you a cruel person, but you're also pretty dumb and you do dumb things. you do NOT get to end up with me in the end thats just not whats meant to be, i get that now ... i see it now why it never worked out. once i cant stand someone, theyre dead to me and i cannot stand you.

oh and i get phone numbers all the time, so that wasnt a big deal to me.

thats all from me
