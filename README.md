# DoNOTInteractWithMyGithubOrElseIWillGet-M-S-K-C-C-Involved-ImVerySerious

im trying to help you out but please do not interact with my github

that really could have been me that you would have cheated on for 8+ yrs (i dunno when your relationship started but im assuming that when i called you in 2018, you guys were together, so thats why there was attitude on the phone)

you are the cruelest person ive ever known/met whatever, and i dont want that for myself

just a complete waste of time

i will take screenshots and escalate things to my manager/PI/group leader at m s k c c if i see activity on github from you or if you call/email me -- i am very very serious

leave me alone

**let this go**

stop wasting my time

nobody helped me with anything, i did it all by myself: i got to rutgers by myself, i got to penn by myself, i got to bethesda by myself, i got to sampled by myself and im now at m s k c c and i made it here by myself

i could spend another 8 yrs by giving you the benefit of the doubt but its exhausting at this point and i just dont want to


im going to reiterate this again, please do NOT contact me in anyway, my SIL is an attorney in nyc we are not weak people, you do not want to do this

you're just messing around with as many women as you can.

you're just not a serious person and i cannot stand that and i will never put up with that.
