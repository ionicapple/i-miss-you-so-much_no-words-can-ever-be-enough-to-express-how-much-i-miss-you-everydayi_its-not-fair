<!--
im trying to help you out but please do not interact with my github

that really could have been me that you would have cheated on for 8+ yrs (i dunno when your relationship started but im assuming that when i called you in 2018, you guys were together, so thats why there was attitude on the phone)

you are the cruelest person ive ever known/met whatever, and i dont want that for myself

just a complete waste of time

i will take screenshots and escalate things to my manager/PI/group leader at m s k c c if i see activity on github from you or if you call/email me -- i am very very serious

leave me alone

**let this go**

stop wasting my time

nobody helped me with anything, i did it all by myself: i got to rutgers by myself, i got to penn by myself, i got to bethesda by myself, i got to sampled by myself and im now at m s k c c and i made it here by myself

i could spend another 8 yrs by giving you the benefit of the doubt but its exhausting at this point and i just dont want to


im going to reiterate this again, please do NOT contact me in anyway, my SIL is an attorney in nyc we are not weak people, you do not want to do this

you're just messing around with as many women as you can.

you're just not a serious person and i cannot stand that and i will never put up with that.

i realized this as i was recording the voicenote over the weekend, i thought, i dont really want to talk to you, you're such a mean person ... so i finally understood why it never worked out.

im not for putting other women down but ill make a small exception to make a quick point. go to your fking wife if you want someone to make you laugh, dont come to me, you chose her so proudly right over me? so go to her, fk off. is she just not funny, and thats why you're always here? hmmm ... theres nothing you can do for me at this point (or ever actually) but waste my time even more.

my intuition says that you most likely met her on the internet and me, the person who fking drove from philly the night before, you wanted to fk around with, you could just never accept or believe that something good could happen to you with me -- so not only are you a cruel person, but you're also pretty dumb and you do dumb things. you do NOT get to end up with me in the end thats just not whats meant to be, i get that now ... i see it now why it never worked out. once i cant stand someone, theyre dead to me and i cannot stand you.

oh and i get phone numbers all the time, so that wasnt a big deal to me.

thats all from me


im not talking to u bc ur married and i need to figure out what im doing with my life talking and sending hrs long voice notes to a married man that also one that didnt choose me.

but i wanted to add more information to some things

> attitude on the phone

oh, you have NEVER seen attitude like mine ... arrogance ... you have never seen a more arrogent person than me, you have met your fking match with me ... im a connoisseur of arrogent people in academia, i know i can outdo them. moreover, i am such a competitive person thats how my parents raised me to be, to be the absolute best in whatever im doing

> cheating

with me, you have lost all privileges to your PHONE (which is an android), honey, im going to get you a phone where all you can do is take calls, send/recieve work emails and that's IT. everything you do, will be monitored by me 24/7, even when you SLEEP. eveywhere you go, anybody you talk to, im going to know EVERYTHING, every single thing. you will be monitored by people you dont even know about, at the least being my family. thats what youre signing up for. any new friend you want to make, get approved by me, you dont get to hang around with trash people. you will be in absolute complete surveillance by me.

> new phone for you

https://minimalcompany.com/ something like this, i know there are others, all you will be able to do is: make calls, work emails, read books, listen to podcasts, call an uber and thats IT, that's all you need

> laugh

oh i can make you laugh, but if you miss any one of your five daily prayers, youre sleeping in the living room until you make it up. drinking/drugs, its over on the first attempt, i will not put up with it AT ALL, not even a sip.

> lie

you lie to me about anything, i am from nj and im pakistani, its like the perfect storm of anger when it comes out which it rarely does bc im mostly a chill person. i will find out if you're lying TO ME and it'll be absolutely over for you. i dont lie to people.

if you want to hide anything from me, i swear i will find out, i always find out.

> potential wife # 3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJEAGd1bQuc there will not be wife # 3 for you i am so fking serious

nooo ... it ENDS with me and that's all im going to say about that

IM PISSED

you want this? figure your shit out now ... do not underestimate me im a very serious person. the older i get the more i realize that its very important to live life seriously there is no other way, i have fun but im strict and im a serious person

oh and i can be as mean as i want to you, bc you fwded my emails to penn of all places, that is some fked up shit, you are the meanest person ever that could ever exist

you're turkish and youre going to tell me what to do? HONEY i am a pakistani WOMAN have you MET US do you know what youre signing up for

oh and i like to look put together when i leave the house, so if youre going anywhere with me, 1. you have to go to the barbershop regularly 2. i dont like tshirts + jeans -- but im going to dress you up, im going to give you a new wardrobe, what are you doing with your life im so confused
